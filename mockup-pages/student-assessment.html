        <h3>Early Learning</h3>
        <p>Devereux Center for Resilient Children develops a variety of strength-based assessments and strategy resources.

        <h3>Middle School</h3>

        <p>Pride Surveys, founded in 1982, has a strong track record of measuring behavior that can affect student learning, such as drug and alcohol use, family issues, and school climate. In keeping with that tradition, Proide has created the Social, Emotional, and Bullying Behavior Survey (SEBBS) for middle school use. With the SEBBS, educators can assess their students' pre- and post-test knowledge and measure outcomes gained from the <em>Second Step</em> program.</p>
