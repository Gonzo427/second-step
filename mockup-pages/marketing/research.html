          <p><strong>We take great pride in the fact that our programs are based on current research in the field.</strong> Translating research into our programs is a key component in the development of our curriculum. This allows us to be more confident that our programs will be effective once implemented in classrooms. In addition, we are committed to evaluating our programs for effectiveness through randomized control trials.</p>
          <p>Only through these research trials can we be certain our programs meet their intended objectives. Through rigorous research in the development of our programs and by evaluating the outcomes of our programs, we strive to provide a truly effective curriculum that helps children improve their social-emotional skills and be successful in school and in life.</p>

Programa Compasso is a Brazilian SEL program developed by Ana Luiza Colagrossi and colleagues from the Instituto Vila Educação and based on the Second Step curriculum. Using a randomized control trial in more than 90 primary schools, the evaluation’s objective is to understand the impact of Programa Compasso in terms of improving teacher outcomes, student social-emotional wellbeing, and student academic performance.</p>

           <p>This study (the first with the 2011 edition of the Second Step program) conducted a randomized controlled trial over a one-year period with 7300 students and 321 teachers in 61 schools across six school districts, from kindergarten to second grade. Significant improvements in social-emotional competence and behavior were made by children who started the school year with skill deficits in these areas. Additionally, the number of lessons completed and student engagement were predictive of improved student outcomes.</p>

           <p>In a study released in July 2015 that examined nearly 20 years of data from the Fast Track Research Project, researchers found that teacher-rated social competence in kindergarten consistently and significantly predicted outcomes in education, employment, criminal justice, substance use, and mental health into adulthood. Kindergarteners with higher social competence scores were measurably more likely to attain a college degree, more likely to earn a high school diploma, and more likely to have a full-time job at age 25.</p>

           <p>This pioneering report from Columbia University details a benefit-cost analysis evaluating six SEL interventions (including the Second Step program) that shows an average return on investment of $11 for every dollar spent. Until now there has been little-to-no data to show policymakers and grant givers the economic benefits of SEL curriculum. The researchers acknowledge the limitations of imprecise data and say their conservative estimates may not capture the full benefits of the SEL programs evaluated. Known benefits of the interventions studied include: reductions in child aggression, substance abuse, delinquency, and violence; lower levels of depression and anxiety; and increased grades, attendance, and performance in core academic subjects.</p>
