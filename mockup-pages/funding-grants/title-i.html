        <h2>Title I and Our Programs</h2>
        <p>Our programs may align with the following sections of Title I.</p>
        <h3>Section 1001.1: Curricula and Assessments</h3>
        <p>Section 1001.1 calls for "ensuring that high-quality academic assessments, accountability systems, teacher preparation and training, curriculum, and instructional materials are aligned with challenging state academic standards."</p>
        <p class="regular">See how following programs align with academic content standards:</p>

        <p>The <a href="/student-assessment">Devereux Early Childhood Assessment (DECA)</a> and the <a href="/student-assessment">Devereux Student Strengths Assessment&mdash;<em>Second Step</em> Edition (DESSA–SE)</a>, which assess early learning and K&ndash;5
          students' positive-emotional resources and abilities, might also apply.</p>
        <h3>Sections 1001.1 and 1001.10: Teacher Preparation, Training, and Professional Development</h3>
        <p>Section 1001.10 calls for "significantly elevating the quality of instruction by providing staff in participating schools with substantial opportunities for professional development." (See above for wording for Section 1001.1.)</p>
        <p class="regular"><a href="/funding-grants/federal-funding-options/title-i/teacher-training">Read about teacher training and professional development in our programs.</a></p>
        <p>The <em>Second Step</em> program also addresses several issues that relate to <a href="/funding-grants/federal-funding-options/title-i/teacher-retention">teacher attrition</a>.</p>
        <h3>Sections 1001.2 and 1001.3: Closing the Achievement Gap</h3>
        <p>Title I specifically encourages efforts to address the achievement gap between high- and low-performing students. Students with more of the social-emotional competencies taught in the <em>Second Step</em> program have <a href="/funding-grants/federal-funding-options/title-i/academics">greater success in school</a>.
          They get better grades, have higher standardized test scores, better relationships with peers, and fewer disciplinary problems. Social-emotional competence also makes it less likely students will be involved in violence, delinquency, and substance
          abuse.
        </p>
        <p>For many students, the disadvantages that accompany low socioeconomic status (SES) result in their academic achievement not matching that of their higher-SES peers. One of those disadvantages for students from low-SES families and neighborhoods
          is that they can have lower levels of social-emotional competence than other students. However curricula such as the <em>Second Step</em> program have been shown to help students, both advantaged and disadvantaged, build those competencies.</p>
        <p class="regular">The good news for the achievement gap is there is evidence that these types of programs actually produce stronger effects for students from low-SES communities or families than for their more advantaged peers. The <em>Second Step</em> program
          specifically has been shown to increase social competence for all groups of students, but to boost the social competence of low-SES students more than that of their middle- and upper-SES peers.</p>

        <h3>Section 1001.8: More Time for Teaching</h3>
        <p>Section 1001.8 calls for "providing children an enriched and accelerated educational program, including the use of schoolwide programs or additional services that increase the amount and quality of instructional time."</p>
        <p>Better student behavior means teachers can spend less time on classroom management and more on teaching. <em>Second Step</em> lessons emphasize fundamental social-emotional skills that can help students in the classroom and beyond. These skills
          have been shown to <a href="/Portals/0/Product/Funding/DOC/durlak-weissberg-et-al-sb-meta-analysis-2011.pdf"> reduce classroom problems such as misbehavior and aggression</a> <span class="small">(PDF)</span>, and many schools have found that
          the program can help <a href="http://www.cfchildren.org/second-step/success-stories/fewer-disciplinary-referrals" target="_blank">reduce discipline referrals</a>.</p>
        <h3>Section 1002(d): Prevention and Intervention Programs</h3>
        <p>Section 1002(d) allocates funds for "prevention and intervention programs for youth who are neglected, delinquent, or at-risk." The <em>Second Step</em> curriculum is a prevention and intervention program. The <em>Second Step</em> Middle School
          program may apply especially well in this category since it is based on strengthening protective factors and reducing risk factors and it includes substance abuse prevention lessons.</p>
        <h3>Section 1002(h): Dropout Prevention</h3>
        <p class="regular">Section 1001(h) allocates funds for dropout prevention. Fostering a better school climate using social-emotional learning programs may help increase students' bonds to school and reduce student dropout. <a href="/funding-grants/federal-funding-options/title-i/dropout-prevention">Read more about the <em>Second Step</em> program and dropout prevention</a>.</p>
