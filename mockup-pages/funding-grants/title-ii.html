        <h2>Title II and Our Programs</h2>
        <p>Title II, Part A, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) is the teacher and principal training and recruiting fund. Section 2101 states that the purpose of this part is to "increase student academic achievement through strategies
          such as improving teacher and principal quality and increasing the number of highly qualified teachers in the classroom and highly qualified principals and assistant principals in schools."</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/programs/teacherqual/guidance.pdf" target="_blank">guidance document for Title II, Part A</a> <span class="small">(PDF)</span>, provides a list of criteria for high-quality professional development laid out by
          the ESEA. Our <em>Second Step</em> program and Bullying Prevention Unit include trainings and other tools for teachers, program coordinators, and administrators that may align our programs with the following criteria from that list.</p>
        <p>[Programs] are designed as an integral part of broad schoolwide and districtwide educational improvement plans</p>
        <p>The <em>Second Step</em> program and Bullying Prevention Unit were designed to be taught school- or districtwide and include trainings and tools to help staff implement the programs and improve the climate of the entire school or district. The
          <em>Second Step</em> program teaches students skills to help them succeed academically, manage emotions, solve problems, and get along with peers. The Bullying Prevention Unit teaches students to recognize, report, and refuse bullying, and helps
          staff create and implement schoolwide bullying policies and procedures for reporting and responding to bullying and coaching the students involved.</p>
        <p>[Programs] give teachers and principals the knowledge and skills to help students meet challenging state academic standards</p>
        <p class="regular">The skills for learning taught in the <em>Second Step</em> Early Learning and K&ndash;5 lessons and the Brain Builder games in Early Learning and K&ndash;3 lessons strengthen core self-regulation and executive-function skills that help students
          learn&mdash;such as listening, following directions, and focusing attention. Teachers are given instructions and tips for teaching these skills and games, and video models of many of the activities are provided in the online Teaching Guide.
          In addition, each unit in Early Learning and K&ndash;8 includes ideas and techniques for integrating <em>Second Step</em> skills into academics.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>The <em>Second Step</em> program provides teachers with a wide variety of instructional and management techniques, which are outlined in the Teaching Guide and embedded in the lessons themselves. Video models of some techniques are also provided.
          The Bullying Prevention Unit contains tools to teach staff about bullying and how to set up discipline procedures, handle bullying incidents, and coach students involved.</p>

        <p>[Programs] are sustained, intensive, and classroom-focused, and not one-day or short-term workshops</p>
        <p>The <em>Second Step</em> program and Bullying Prevention Unit include either online training or outlines, handouts, scripts, and videos for training staff. The <em>Second Step</em> Early Learning and K&ndash;5 programs and the Bullying Prevention
          Unit also contain materials for follow-up meetings or trainings. In addition, teachers of both the <em>Second Step</em> program and the Bullying Prevention Unit practice program teaching and classroom management techniques throughout the weeks
          that they teach the lessons in the classroom. The <em>Second Step</em> program for all grades also contains lesson observation forms that can be used to provide feedback for every lesson, and the elementary and early learning curricula include
          reflection logs and success story logs to document successes and challenges.</p>
        <p>[Programs] advance teacher understanding of effective instruction strategies that are based on scientifically based research</p>
        <p class="regular">The <em>Second Step</em> program and Bullying Prevention Unit provide teachers with a wide variety of instructional and management techniques, which are outlined in the Teaching Guides and embedded in the lessons themselves. Both programs are
          research-based.</p>
