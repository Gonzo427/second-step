        <h2>Head Start &amp; Our Programs</h2>
        <p><strong>The <em>Second Step</em> Early Learning program and the Child Protection Unit align with Head Start Performance Standards. The standards with the strongest connections to our programs are listed below.</strong></p>

        <h3>Child Development</h3>
        <p>Parts A and C call for creation of a positive environment, support for children’s social-emotional development, and development of cognitive and language skills. The <em>Second Step</em> Early Learning program and Child Protection Unit aim to help improve school climate and strengthen children’s social-emotional skills. In addition, the <em>Second Step</em> Early Learning program contains lessons to help children learn to focus attention, use self-talk, be assertive, and listen—skills crucial for school success—and a unit for transitioning to kindergarten.</p>


        <h3>Child Health and Safety</h3>
        <p>Part D calls for fostering safety awareness. One of the major goals of the Child Protection Unit is to teach children how to keep themselves safe using personal safety skills.</p>

        <h3>Family Partnerships</h3>
        <p>Part E calls for fostering partnerships with parents and caregivers. The <em>Second Step</em> Early Learning program includes a Home Link activity for each week of the program for children to complete with an adult family member. These activities allow families to participate in the program with children and are provided in English and Spanish.</p>
        <p>The <em>Second Step</em> program also includes an access code so families can visit SecondStep.org, where there is a special Family section containing videos and other materials to help get families involved in the program.</p>
        <p>The Child Protection Unit includes Child Protection Resources for Families, which is a suite of short videos and articles that explain to parents how and why to talk to their children to help them stay safe from sexual abuse. The resources are available for free: Child Protection Resources for Families.</p>
        <p>In addition, both the <em>Second Step</em> program and Child Protection Unit contain Family Letters to communicate to parents and caretakers what children are learning.</p>

        <h3>Teacher Training and Development</h3>
        <p>Part K calls for training for teachers. Read more about our programs and teacher training and staff development.</p>

        <h3>Early Learning Assessment</h3>
        <p>The Devereux Early Childhood Assessment (DECA) Kit and training program helps educators assess child resiliency and social-emotional competence—key areas of child mental health—and may also be eligible for Head Start funds. <em>Second Step</em> lessons strengthen children’s self-control, attachment, and initiative—important protective factors measured in the DECA Program.</p>
