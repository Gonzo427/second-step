#Notes

- For wrapping lines and to avoid orphans at various screen sizes: Add `&nbsp;` between last two words in paragraphs and lists
	- just make a note on page in the style guide?


- Line heights for `p`, `ul`, `ol` are enormous.  Really want 42 line-height?  Think it might look different in the browser

- `ol` number styling—doable but somewhat complicated, & would have to attach a class
	same goes for making square bullets smaller

- Strong tags: should be able to apply
 	```
	strong {
		font-family: “ProximaNovaSemi”;
	}
	```
