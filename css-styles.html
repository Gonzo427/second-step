        Jay, Ignore the Helvetica Header styles I had in the CSS, it is wrong. I styled the Font Stack for Header inline, see HTML

        FONT STACK (What is current?)

        NOTE FROM MARK ON FONT STACK
I changed the font for the Cart pop-up window buttons to Proxima Nova SemiBold (or as it’s defined in the v6.css, “proxima_nova_ltsemibold”), in the “ssShopper.theme”.

#dnntopbar #dnn_ShoppingCart .dnnFormPopup .rvdsfCartSummaryActions a {
height: 32px;
padding-top: 5px;
width: 50%;
margin: 20px auto;
font-family: "proxima_nova_ltsemibold", Helvetica, Arial, "sans-serif";
}

It probably won’t have to fall back to the other fonts, but if you have something heavier in mind other than Helvetica, Arial, or sans, let me know and I’ll  put them in.

Projects may originate in schools and expand outward to families and communities, or they may be delivered directly to children, parents, or community service providers. They may support children from birth through college-age. Regardless, the basic tenets remain the same: projects must be bound by our mission of fostering the social and emotional development, safety, and well-being of children. They should also solve unmet needs, be scalable, future-oriented, financially viable, and tied to effective practice.</p>
            <h4 class="rule">Innovation Is No Longer About Going It Alone</h4>
            <p>The vision for New Mission Ventures is ambitious, but we&#39;re off to a good start. Since launching in the fall of 2013, we have several projects already in development. Current partners include cross-sector experts and cutting-edge organizations from around the nation working with us to improve the lives of children.</p>
